			<h1>WHAT I AM LEARNING</h1>
			<p>Mayden Academy has taken up the challenge of teaching ME
                to be a FULLSTACK DEVELOPER in just 4 months! Unlikely I hear you say!
				I have high hopes they can...
                Above show the list of languages which I will be learning</p>

				<p>Born and bread in London. I went to a French school in London (a long story for another day)
						but switched to English A-levels before going to UCL again in London!
						At UCL i studied Bio-chemical Engineering which taught me how to make pills from plasmids.
						I needed a job (any job) and found myself being interviewed in the city and getting
						a job as a junior accountant for an investment bank where I worked until the big move.

				<p>My wife is from Bath and we would come back to visit family and friends.
						We always talked about brining up our children out of London and couldnâ€™t think of
						a better place. So in Aug 2017 we picked up and moved 100miles down the M4 to junction 18.
						For me this was a great opportunity for me to switch career to a new industry as
						a full stack developer.</p>

                <p>Challenge was to copy the Mayden Logo using only CSS! None of this right click business!
				This is harder than it sounds. Playing around with CSS shapes, border radius,
